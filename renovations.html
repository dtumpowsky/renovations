		<h2><strong><em>John Doe Reviews</em></strong></h2>
		<p>John Doe's Statment </p> 
		<p>I hired this company to do a deck job and to replace my roof. On both projects they did a phenomenal job. </p> 
		<p>Totally exceeded my expectations, and my expectations are generally very high. The owner (Mark) did a great job throughout the projects </p> 
		<p>and his teams worked tirelessly to complete the projects on time and with great detail. I will definitely use them again.</p>
